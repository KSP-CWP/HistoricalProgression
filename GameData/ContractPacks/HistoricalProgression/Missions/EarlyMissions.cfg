    description = The V-2, technical name Aggregat-4 (A-4), was the world's first long-range guided ballistic missile. The missile with a liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a "vengeance weapon," designed to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities. The V-2 rocket also became the first artificial object to cross the boundary of space with the vertical launch of V-177 on 20 June 1944.\n\n<b><color=white>Objectives:</color></b>\n\n1. Design an unmanned rocket\n2. Launch the Rocket\n3. Reach Space\n4. Destroy the Rocket\n\n<b><color=white>Significance:</color></b> The V-2, or A-4 was the first man made object to cross the Karman line and reach space. This early rocket was the basis of the rockets developed in both the USSR and USA that would. After WWII, the German scientists that worked on the project helped to develop the technology in both countries.\n\n<b><color=white>Historical Launch Date:</color></b> June 20, 1944
    
	completedMessage = Success! The V-2 Rocket, and the German scientists working on it, became the foundation of the rocketry programs in both the USSR and USA.

    completedMessage = Success! Sputnik 1 is one of the most significant events of the Space Race between the USA and USSR. This monumental achievement was proof of how far ahead the USSR were at this point in history. The fact that the satellite was orbiting above the Earth terrified people in the United States as many thought the Soviets could drop a bomb from something similar.

    description = Sputnik 2 was the second spacecraft launched into Earth orbit, and the first to carry a living animal, a dog named Laika. Sputnik 2 was a 4-meter (13 foot) high cone-shaped capsule with a base diameter of 2 meters (6.6 feet) that weighed around 500 kg, though it was not designed to separate from the rocket core that brought it to orbit, bringing the total mass in orbit to 7.79 tons.\n\n<b><color=white>Objectives:</color></b>\n\n1.

It remained in orbit until 1970, and has been followed by more than 90 scientific spacecraft in the Explorer series.
